## Scripts

### obs-audio.sh

Make a new output sink called `obs_audio`. Audio that is being outputted to this sink can also be heard from the default sink. Built so I can listen to music and attend online meetings while it's being recorded with OBS. Set to run on every startup.

### cleanup.sh

It does a disk cleanup of systemd journals and caches (pacman, pamac and yay). Set to run manually using an alias.

### java-new-project.sh

Creates a new project folder structure for Java with Visual Studio Code. Set to run manually using an alias.
